<h1>This will show how the .push() and .pop() can manipulate arrays.</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3><code>.push()</code> adds an element in an array.</h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3><code>.pop()</code> removes an element in an array.</h3>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  From my previous experiences with JS and Python, these two have similar functions with respect to each programming language.
  The deal with ADTs is that high level languages use these functions to do something without us, the programmers really knowing 
  what's going on behind the scenes. 
</p>
<p><strong>Here are the differences in use-cases for JS and Python:</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>JavaScript</th>
      <th>Python</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>
          <code>.push()</code> - pushes an element at the end of the array <br>
          <p>
            <i>Example:</i> <br>
            Let's say you have an array <strong><i>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</i></strong> and you want to add 6 to the end of it. <code>.push()</code>
            can let you do that.<br>
            <code>let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code><br>
            <code>arr.push(6);</code><br>
            <strong>result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</strong>
          </p>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
